`pytools` is an open source library containing general machine learning and visualisation
utilities for reuse, including:

- Basic tools for API development, supporting documentation, deprecation, and run-time validation
- Support for simulating classification and regression data
- Utilities for constructing complex expressions and rendering them as indented strings
- Support for fitting objects to data, and testing whether an object is fitted
- Parallelization based on the joblib package
- A lean MVC framework for rendering basic visualizations in different styles, e.g., as Matplotlib charts or as plain text

TODO - add git badges as substitutions
