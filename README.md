## 1. Setup
### 1.1 Python Environment
There is a `environment.yml` provided in the project root folder, which you can use with Anaconda to set up a virtualenv for yieldengine.
### 1.2 Pytest
Simply run `pytest tests/` from the project root folder (or use the PyCharm testrunner). The execution of pytest with coverage can be triggered using `pytest --cov=yieldengine tests/`.
### 1.3 Sphinx Documentation
The generated Sphinx documentation of yieldengine is located at _/docs_. To build the documentation, ensure you have the Python packages `sphinx=2.0.1` and `sphinx_rtd_theme=0.4.3` installed, which we have purposely not included into the `environment.yml`. To update, simply run `make html` from within _/sphinx_. **Note: the Makefile (-> make.bat) has not been adapted/tested for Windows**

## 2. Documentation guideline
The documentation is written in docstrings. 
The style fo the docstring follows ReStructuredText syntax which is the default for 
Sphinx.
