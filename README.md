## 1. Setup
### 1.1 Python Environment
There is a `environment.yml` provided in the project root folder, which you can use with Anaconda to set up a virtualenv for yieldengine.
### 1.2 Pytest
Simply run `pytest tests/` from the project root folder (or use the PyCharm testrunner). The execution of pytest with coverage can be triggered using `pytest --cov=yieldengine tests/`.
### 1.3 Sphinx Documentation
The generated Sphinx documentation of yieldengine is located at _/docs_. To build the documentation, ensure you have the Python packages `sphinx=2.0.1` and `sphinx_rtd_theme=0.4.3` installed, which we have purposely not included into the `environment.yml`. To update, simply run `make html` from within _/sphinx_. **Note: the Makefile (-> make.bat) has not been adapted/tested for Windows**

## 2. Documentation guideline
The documentation is written inside the docstrings. 
The style fo the docstring follows the reStructuredText syntax which is the default 
syntax for Sphinx.
Docstring are writen in an imperative style for instance. So write  
```"""Do this."""```   
instead of   
```"""Does this."""```  

Do not add a blank line after the starting triple quotes """ of a docstring.

A one-liner docstring is of the form:  
```"""This is a one-liner docstring."""``` 
For a one-liner docstring there is no blank line a after the docstring.

If the docstring does not fit in one line it should look like:  
```
"""Short description.

Optionnal longer description.
That can be on multiple line.

:param param_1: description of param_1
:return: the return value
"""
```  
Modules and classes must have a docstring. 
Methods and attributes which are public must have a docstring but methods and 
attributes which are private do not need a docstring.

Property attributes of a class are documented as attributes and not as methods. For 
instance use
```
@property
    def foo(self) -> Foo:
        """The foo object."""
        pass
```
instead of 
```
@property
    def foo(self) -> Foo:
        """
        :return: the foo object"""
        pass
```
